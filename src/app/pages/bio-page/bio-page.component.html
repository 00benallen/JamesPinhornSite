          <p>Hi! My name is James Pinhorn.
            <br> I am a native of St. John’s, Newfoundland where I appeared frequently on stage and on CBC Radio and Television
            as a boy soprano and actor.

              My University Career
            </mat-panel-title>
          </mat-expansion-panel-header>
          <p>I moved to Toronto in 1985 and completed a Bachelor of Music in Vocal Performance at the University of Toronto.
            During a year of Special Studies in Elementary Education and Choral Conducting at the University, I served as
            the Assistant Conductor of the Concert Choir conducted by Doctor Doreen Rao. During that year I was invited by
            Dr. Rao to conduct the choir in a performance of Sharon Fragments at a gala concert honouring Canadian composer
            John Beckwith. That same year I was invited by Robert Cooper to conduct the back-stage chorus in three performances
            of Ravel’s ballet Daphnis et Chloe for the National Ballet of Canada. I served as conductor of the University
            Chorus at the University of Toronto for two years before accepting the post as conductor of the University Women’s
            Chorus which I held for 6 years. I was also a vocal coach for the Toronto Mendelssohn Youth Choir, and was the
            guest chorus conductor for Robert Cooper in two performances of the opera Marina for the Opera in Concert Chorus
            in December of 1996.</p>
