        Here you will find the five Christmas Carols my grandfather used to sing with the men in Norman's Cove, 
        Trinity Bay, Newfoundland many years ago.  To get the notes as accurate as possible, 
        I consulted my Uncle Cle Newhook on the words in certain verses, as well as my Mom, 
        Florence Pinhorn who heard the carols sung in her kitchen many times by her father.  
        I also made use of two separate recordings of my Grandfather, Ernest Newhook singing 
        these carols, and information from my Great Uncle Hubert Newhook about the history of the 
        carols.
